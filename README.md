# pdf-to-speech
I have issues reading pdfs and listening to them helps me out massively! So I'm working on a user-friendly application that can be given a pdf (or txt file) and spit out a WAV or MP3 file.
In the future, this'll be a fun server that'll do the hard work, but for now, it'll just be a python/bash project.
This is a small personal project, so there won't be regular updates *per se*, but when I have time I'll push what I've got.

Remember to --recurse-submodules when you clone.

## The Pipeline
input.pdf -> ocrmypdf (ghostscript->tesseract-ocr) -> preprocessing (regex) -> ocr correction (BERT) -> postprocessing (regex) -> text to speech (Mozilla TTS) -> wav to mp3 (pydub~ffmpeg) -> out.mp3
The slowest parts will almost certainly be BERT and TTS, so it'd be nice to train student models for those when I have resources.
