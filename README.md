# pdf-to-speech
I have issues reading pdfs and listening to them helps me out massively! So I'm working on a user-friendly application that can be given a pdf (or txt file) and spit out a WAV or MP3 file.
In the future, this'll be a fun server that'll do the hard work, but for now, it'll just be a python/bash project.
This is a small personal project, so there won't be regular updates *per se*, but when I have time I'll push what I've got.

Nothing I'm doing here is new or especially interesting (right now) so feel free to use this for whatever.
