# pdf-to-speech
I have issues reading pdfs and listening to them helps me out massively! Here's my setup to digitize pdfs.

Nothing I'm doing here is new or especially interesting so feel free to use this for whatever.
## to-do
[ ] Remove dependence on Qubes OS being awesome

[ ] Allow for batch "recordings"

[ ] Integrate a tts engine with actual i n f l e c t i o n (looking at you Mozilla TTS)

[ ] Be able to mix this with other audio like a song in the background or something

[ ] Maybe set up a server for a library thing where I can push files and stream audio?
